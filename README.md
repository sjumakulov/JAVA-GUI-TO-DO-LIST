# To_do_list
my first Java GUI program created on 09.April.2021.

I think you will forgive my messy code.

In this to_do_list program, you can create different lists and inside each list you can add your tasks. Each list created will get a different random color. You can also edit, remove, and save your lists/tasks.

Thanks for reading.
